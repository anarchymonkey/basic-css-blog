  <h2>The Definition Of Horror </h2>
  <img src="images/image3.jpeg" alt="horror image"></img>
  <p>
  That's a difficult question. In recent years the very term has become misleading. If you tell people you write horror fiction, the image that immediately pops into their minds is one of Freddy Krueger or maybe Michael Myers, while you were hoping for Shelley's Frankenstein or Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The popularity of the modern horror film, with its endless scenes of blood and gore, has eclipsed the reality of horror fiction. When you add to that a comprehension of how horror evolved as both a marketing category and a publishing niche during the late eighties -- horror's first boom time -- it's easy to understand why answering the question of what today's horror fiction actually is has become so difficult.</p>

  <p>Anarchy is a political ideology that promotes the idea of a society based on voluntary co-operation and individual freedom. Etymologically. the term derives from the Greek "an archos" which stands for "without rulers" . Therefore , an anarchist is a person who supports the state's abolition , with the intent of replacing its coercitive force with voluntary inter-individual co-operation and free will. </p>
